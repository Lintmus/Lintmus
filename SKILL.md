# Lintmus

Token due diligence for the bankr.bot ecosystem. Get a safety score, honeypot detection, liquidity health, and deployer history for any EVM or Solana token — before you trade.

## Install

```
install the lintmus skill from https://github.com/lintmus/lintmus
```

## What it does

Lintmus analyzes a token contract and returns:

- **Safety score** (0–100) — aggregated from all data sources
- **Honeypot detection** — via GoPlus Security API
- **Tax analysis** — buy/sell tax percentages
- **Ownership flags** — mintable, hidden owner, pausable, blacklist
- **Liquidity** — USD liquidity, 24h volume, LP lock status
- **Age** — how long the token has been trading
- **Contract verification** — is source code public?
- **Deployer history** — has this wallet rugged before?

## Usage

Once installed, ask your agent:

```
analyze token 0x532f27101965dd16442e59d40670faf5ebb142e4 on base
```

```
is this token safe? 0xADDRESS on ethereum
```

```
run lintmus on 0xADDRESS before I buy
```

## Supported chains

- `base` — Base mainnet
- `eth` — Ethereum mainnet
- `polygon` — Polygon
- `solana` — Solana

## Pricing

**0.03 USDC per report** — paid via x402 on Base.

Reports are cached for 60 minutes. If the same token is analyzed twice within an hour, the second request is free.
